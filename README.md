# pawn-shop-client-private

Otherwise known as the frontend component of `üí∏‚ú®üé∏ nft pawn shop üíç‚ú®üí∏`

## Developing

Install all deps by running `yarn`

### Running on rinkeby

By default, just running `yarn dev` runs the frontend hooked up to the rinkeby testnet. Our app will allow you to mint NFTs and Rinkeby DAI at http://localhost:3000/test. You'll need some Rinkeby eth for gas.

### Running locally

1. Create `.env.local` (`touch .env.local`) with the below. Update using locally deployed contract addresses (detailed instructions coming soon).
